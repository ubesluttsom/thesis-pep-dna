2003-11-25  Julian T. J. Midgley  <jtjm@xenoclast.org>

	* Released [autobench-2-1-1]

	* autobench, autobench.1, autobench_admin:
	Added support for httperf options that don't take an argument (such as
	--ssl).  See the autobench man page for details.

2003-07-27  Julian T. J. Midgley  <jtjm@xenoclast.org>

	* autobench, autobench.1, autobench_admin:
	Added new option --const_test_time which allows all tests to be forced
	to take approximately the same real time; this prevents the early
	tests in a series taking several times longer than the later ones, and
	makes it easier to ensure that the test will last long enough for
	httperf to sample.

2003-05-06  Julian T. J. Midgley  <jtjm@xenoclast.org>

	* autobench:
	Now performs more thorough checking of options supplied in the
	config file or on the command line

2003-01-18  Julian T. J. Midgley  <jtjm@xenoclast.org>

	* bench2graph:
	Fixed bug caused by hasty fix in rev 1.3 whereby the temporary
	output file was deleted immediately after creation.  Patch
	supplied by Steve Greenland <steve at lsli.com>.

2002-12-10  Julian T. J. Midgley  <jtjm@xenoclast.org>

2002-10-15  Julian T. J. Midgley  <jtjm@xenoclast.org>

	receives "ABORT" and SIGTERMs its child.

	* Released [autobench-2-0-1]

	CWD instead of putting it where you asked for it.

	* autobenchd:
	Tidied up debugging output, and added --verbose option for monitoring
	progress

	* autobenchd:
	Ensured that the child handles failed httperf runs correctly (by
	checking for 0 replies), and fixed get_command()'s handling of EAGAINS

	* autobench_admin:
	Admin controller for distributed autobench.  First fully
	functioning version.

	* autobench.conf:
	Added 'clients' config option for distributed autobench

2002-10-13  Julian T. J. Midgley  <jtjm@xenoclast.org>

	* autobenchd:

	processed output back to autobench_admin for collation.

2002-10-12  Julian T. J. Midgley  <jtjm@xenoclast.org>

	* debian/changelog, debian/conffiles, debian/control, debian/copyright, debian/dirs, debian/rules:
	Debianised ;-)

	* Makefile:
	Debianised - now set up either for building a Debian package or
	installing in /usr/local (or elsewhere) in the usual way.

	Added uninstall target which deletes everything.

	Now automatically updates autobench with the correct location of the
	master config file when PREFIX or ETCDIR are changed.
